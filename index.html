            <p class="">You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for
                that
                work. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
                Development
                Hero.</p>

            <p class="">I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my
                grandma how to make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.
